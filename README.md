##How do I even use this!?##
Here's a very quick rundown of how to use it:

1. Get the name of your subreddit.
2. Put it in like this: karma-helper.herokuapp.com/pcmasterrace.json
3. You'll have a JSON with three variables: result, best, and bestScore.

result gives you the total scores of the top 100 hot posts of the subreddit by the hour. Best shows the best hour to post, in UTC, and bestScore is the karma gained by posts posted during that period.
